For my beloved girlfriend.
Hi there, my name is Tung!
I am a second year student at HAMK University.
I am currently living in Finland. I enjoy building
robots and making games in spare time. This game
is my first game and it is completely designed
and programmed by me. It is a christmas present for my girlfriend
and it is just for fun and for people, no commercial use.
