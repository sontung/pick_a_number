## Pick a number

This is my first mini game, written in Christmas 2014.

## Installation

You can download the game by this link, run the file **pick_a_number.exe** and enjoy: https://www.dropbox.com/s/5h0xnz4k7ib585n/dist.rar?dl=0

## Motivation

The game is a Christmas present for my girlfriend, and I also want to make something cool of my own.

##  Contributors

The GUI is powered by Pygame library

And I use **pygame2exe** to change the Python code to an execuatable file that can run on Windows http://www.pygame.org/wiki/Pygame2exe?parent=CookBook
